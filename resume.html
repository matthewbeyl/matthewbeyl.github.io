                <h5>May 2018 - Sept 2018</h5>
                <p>While enrolled as a full time student in Prime Digital Academy's Software Development program, I
                    collaborated daily both working and learning in an open and diverse professional setting. My final
                    projects included two full-stack web applications using Node for the back end and React for the
                    front.</p>

                <h5>Aug 2017 - Aug 2018</h5>
                <p>As an operations team member, I was a part of a small team that maintained the Life Time Target
                    Center club. The main focus of my work there was to stock consumables and perform daily maintenance
                    tasks to ensure the facility and customer experiences were both at their best.</p>

                <h5>July 2014 - Dec 2017</h5>
                <p>In the position of Office Services Coordinator, I was a wearer of many hats. The team I
                    operated as part of liked to quip that our jobs were to do everything at the clinic with the
                    exception of seeing patients. Among these responsibilities were shipping and
                    receiving and inventory management. As an idividual I also took on purchasing, print production,
                    and Sharepoint site
                    owner roles.</p>

                <p>The Production Assistant role, which was also a good deal of quality assurance, meant early and
                    sometimes long hours with duties beginning at production order fulfillment and ranging to shop
                    cleanliness and other odd jobs pending cooperation of the canning equipment.</p>

                <h5>March 2014 - July 2014</h5>
                <p>During the High School Lacrosse season, I served as Lacrosse Specialist at the Minnetonka location.
                    This role allowed me to not only share my passion for the sport with young athletes of all skill
                    levels, but also gave me the opportunity to bring a service (men's and women's stick-stringing) to the
                    sporting goods retailer.</p>

                <h5>Jan 2013 - Nov 2013</h5>
                <p>The Inbound Sales position had me speaking with roughly fifty people a day to give a brief review of
                    their personal banking relationship with Wells Fargo. This was my first experience working
                    with a remote team, as I was often receiving and redirecting customers to my coworkers in other
                    parts of the country - even other parts of the world in some cases.</p>
